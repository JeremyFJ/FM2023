Let's look at Kootenay Lake Bull Trout data from 2013. Mortality, age, and length data was collected (among others) for 20 age groups. 
Retrieved from [github_ypr](https://poissonconsulting.shinyapps.io/shinyypr/)

Let's assume constant recruitment while considering fishing and natural mortality values. 


```{r}
trout = read.csv('laketrout.csv')
```

1) Using an initial population size `N0` of 250 individuals, predict future population sizes using VPA. 

2) Calculate population biomass, catch in numbers, yield per recruit (YPR), and biomass per recruitment (BPR)

3) Plot YPR~F and BPR~F
