Yellowfin tuna fishery data from 1957 can be found from the book: *Using R for Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries* catch, effort, and CPUE from 1934-1955
```{r}
yellow = read.csv("yellowfin1957.csv")
```

1) What is the autocorrelation of this dataset?

2) Use the `Schaefer` and `Fox` models to predict CPUE (incorporate catch)
