Yellowfin tuna fishery data from 1957 can be found from the book: *Using R for Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries* catch, effort, and cpue from 1934-1955

1) Use the `Schaefer` and `Fox` models to predict CPUE (incorporate catch)

2) Optimize parameters, plot, and fit all models

```{r}
schaefdat = read.csv("schaefer.csv")
param <- c(r=0.1,K=2250000,Binit=2250000)
```
